Hey Zander,

Quick favor: when you were playing with Meteor in 2013, you published to Atmosphere a bunch of test package.

The problem is that they clutter the search results now.

Can you please remove them from Atmosphere? Just run

    meteor admin set-unmigrated lezed1:bootstrap-errors
    meteor admin set-unmigrated bootswatch-slate-3

(we now have [official Bootswatch packages](https://atmospherejs.com/bootswatch))

Thanks!
Dan
Atmosphere curator
